To manage your team, go to Settings in your Tazapay Dashboard and navigate to `Team Management -> Manage Team`.

## **Roles and Permissions**

Tazapay uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

- **Owner**: Full access, including settings, transactions, API keys, and team management.
- **Manager**: Permissions can be adjusted.

## **Inviting a Team Member**

1. Click `Invite Teammate`
2. Enter their email.
3. Select a role and adjust access if needed.
4. Send the invite - they'll receive an email to join.

Pending invites show in the list until accepted, with the option to resend.
