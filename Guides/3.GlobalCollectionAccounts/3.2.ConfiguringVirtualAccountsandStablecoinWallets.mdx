title: "Configuring Virtual Accounts and Stablecoin Wallets"
description: "Global Collection Accounts are provisioned based on your business profile, operating countries, and compliance requirements. While every Tazapay account has access to the Global Collection Account capability, individual virtual accounts (fiat) and stablecoin wallets must be configured before you can start receiving funds.
This section explains what identifiers you receive, how configuration works, and what to do after setup."

## What You Receive After Configuration

Once configured, Tazapay provides the following collection identifiers:

### Virtual Accounts (Fiat)

For each virtual account, you receive:

- A unique bank account number (or IBAN, where applicable)
- Associated bank details such as:
  - Bank name
  - Routing number or local clearing code
  - SWIFT code (for wire transfers)
- A fixed currency and domicile country

These details can be shared with your customers to receive funds via local or international bank transfers.

### Stablecoin Wallets

For each stablecoin wallet, you receive:

- A unique wallet address
- The stablecoin type (USDC or USDT)
- The blockchain network the wallet is deployed on\
  (e.g. Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Polygon, etc.)

Only the supported stablecoin and blockchain combination should be used when sending funds to a wallet address.

## How Configuration Works

At present, configuration is assisted by the Tazapay support team to ensure correct setup, regulatory compliance, and optimal routing.

### Step 1: Reach Out to Tazapay Support

To configure virtual accounts or stablecoin wallets, contact:

[**support@tazapay.com**](mailto:support@tazapay.com)

Include the following in your request:

- Your Tazapay Account ID
- Whether you need:
  - Virtual bank accounts
  - Stablecoin wallets (USDC / USDT)
  - Or both
- Required currencies and countries
- For stablecoins: preferred blockchain(s)

### Step 2: Compliance Review

Depending on the currency, country, and expected transaction volume, Tazapay may request additional information as part of compliance and risk checks.

---

### Step 3: Provisioning

Once approved:

- Unique bank account numbers and/or wallet addresses are provisioned
- They become visible on your Tazapay dashboard
- You can immediately start receiving funds

---

## Post-Configuration: Events and Notifications

After configuration, you can:

- Track incoming collections on the dashboard
- Subscribe to webhooks to receive real-time updates for:
  - Incoming payments
  - Compliance holds
  - Successful or failed collections

Webhook endpoints can be configured from the Tazapay dashboard and are recommended for automated reconciliation and system updates.

---

## When to Request Additional Accounts or Wallets

You may request additional configurations if:

- You need to collect in new currencies
- You expand into new countries
- You want separate accounts for reconciliation or entity-level segregation
- You want to support additional blockchains for USDC or USDT

---

## Important Notes

- Each virtual account and wallet address is unique and dedicated.
- Only supported currencies, stablecoins, and blockchains should be used.
- Sending funds on an unsupported blockchain or currency may result in loss of funds.
- Configuration timelines may vary based on jurisdiction and compliance requirements.
