title: "Creating a quote and then attaching it to a payout"
---

This is useful for
- Displaying exchange rates to your customers
- Getting customer acceptance before executing FX
- Locking rates for a short, controlled window

### How it works

1. Create an FX quote via API
2. Quote returns:
    - Exchange rate
    - Validity duration
3. Attach the quote ID while creating the payout
4. Payout executes using the quoted rate

> Quotes are valid only for a limited time duration. Expired quotes cannot be used for payout creation.
