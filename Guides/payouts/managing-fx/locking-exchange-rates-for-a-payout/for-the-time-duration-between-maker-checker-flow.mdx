For dashboard-initiated payouts:
- FX rates can be locked during the maker-checker approval flow
- Once approved, the payout executes using the locked rate
- This prevents rate fluctuation between creation and approval

- Holding balance: USD
- Payout currency: USD

Behavior:

- No FX transaction occurs

    - Payout moves to requires funding
    - Can remain in this state for up to days
    - Automatically transitions to failed if not funded within this period

### Payouts Involving FX
