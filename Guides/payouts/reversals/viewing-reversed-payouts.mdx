All reversed payouts can be directly viewed from the **Payouts** section of the TazaPay Dashboard.

To access reversed payouts:

1. Navigate to **Payouts** in the dashboard
2. Use the **Status** filter at the top of the page
3. Select **Reversed** from the list of available payout states

Once applied, the list displays only payouts that have transitioned to the `reversed` terminal state. Each entry shows the payout ID, amount, beneficiary details, and creation timestamp, with clear visual indication of the reversal status.
