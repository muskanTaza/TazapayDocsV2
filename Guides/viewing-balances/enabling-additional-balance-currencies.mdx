title: "Enabling additional balance currencies"
---

You can enable multiple holding currencies for your business, while designating one primary holding currency.

## When You Might Need Additional Holding Currencies
- You collect funds from customers in different regions
- You pay out beneficiaries in multiple currencies
- You want to avoid unnecessary FX conversions
- You want to manage balances per region or corridor

## How to Enable Holding Currencies
Enabling or updating holding currencies is an assisted process.

To request additional holding currencies or update your primary holding currency:
- Email [support@tazapay.com](mailto:support@tazapay.com), or
- Reach out to your Tazapay Account Manager

### Please share with your Account Manager:
- Your Tazapay registered email address and business name
- The holding currencies you want to enable
- Which currency should be set as the primary holding currency
- Expected use case (collections, payouts, FX, treasury, etc.)

Once enabled, the currencies will appear in your dashboard as separate balances.

## Topping Up Balances
In addition to receiving funds from your customers, you can top up balances directly in any of your enabled balance currencies.

### Supported Top-Up Methods
- Bank transfer into a supported collection account
- Stablecoin transfer to a supported wallet (USDC / USDT, where enabled)

Top-ups are credited directly to the selected holding currency balance and follow the same reconciliation and reporting flows as customer collections.
