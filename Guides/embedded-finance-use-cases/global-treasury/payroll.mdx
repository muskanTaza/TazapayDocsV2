## Overview

Many global employers are headquartered in one country but have teams across regions. Employees may prefer to be paid in local currencies, while employers may receive funds in stablecoins or a single base currency.

Tazapay simplifies this by enabling you to hold funds centrally, convert currencies only when needed, and execute payouts through local payment rails.
