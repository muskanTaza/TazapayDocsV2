title: "How Connected Accounts Work"
---

At a high level, Connected Accounts let you represent your underlying customers within Tazapay in one of two ways:

- Sub-accounts (Each of your customer has their own account within Tazapay)
- Entities (Only you have an account within Tazapay - but pass your customer information with each transaction)

The onboarding method you use determines:

- Whether funds flow through your platform
- Who owns balances and settlements
- The level of onboarding, review, and approval required

The choice between these models depends on your platform’s licenses, compliance setup, and risk assessment, and is evaluated by Tazapay during partner onboarding.
