In this flow:
- Only minimum required details are collected  
- There is no upfront manual approval by the Tazapay onboarding team  
- Entities become usable almost immediately  
- Continuous monitoring is applied post-creation  

This flow is commonly used when platforms need to:
- Rapidly enable payouts on behalf of many businesses or individuals  
- Minimize onboarding friction while maintaining compliance controls

## Information Required for Simplified Onboarding

For simplified onboarding, only basic identifying information is required. This includes:

### For Businesses
- Registered Business Name
- Business Registration Number
- Relationship (vendor, customer, etc.)
- Purpose of Use
- Business Industry Vertical
- Registered Address
- Website (optional but recommended)

### For Individuals
- Full name  
- Relationship (vendor, customer, etc.)
- Purpose of Use
- Address
- Date of Birth (optional but recommended to prevent false sanction hits)
- Nationality (optional but recommended to prevent false sanction hits)

> ⚠️ **Important Note on Mandatory Fields**  
> Although the fields in the documentation may be marked as **mandatory**, simplified onboarding will still work for your account. This is because the flow will be **whitelisted based on prior approval specifically for your account**, allowing reduced data requirements.
