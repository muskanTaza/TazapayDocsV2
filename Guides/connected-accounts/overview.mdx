Connected Accounts allow platforms, marketplaces, and fintechs to onboard and manage their own customers directly on Tazapay, while remaining completely white-labelled.

In this model:

- Your customers can be businesses or individuals
- Tazapay gains the required visibility into underlying customers to meet regulatory and licensing obligations
- The onboarding experience is silent, meaning your customers do not see or interact with Tazapay directly
- Funds movement, compliance checks, FX, and settlement are handled securely by Tazapay in the background

This enables you to resell Tazapay’s global payments and payout capabilities under your own platform experience.
