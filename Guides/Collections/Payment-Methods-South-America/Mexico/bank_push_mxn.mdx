title: "Bank Push Mxn"
---
Refers to payment systems where a sender (payer) initiates a payment directly to a recipient's bank account.

# How It Works

* The sender uses their online banking platform or a dedicated payment gateway integrated with their systems.
* They initiate a payment by providing the recipient's bank account details (CLABE - Clave Bancaria Estandarizada, the standard bank account number in Mexico - and bank name).
* The transaction is authenticated using the sender's banking security protocols (e.g., passwords, tokens, mobile app verification).
* The funds are then directly credited to the recipient's bank account.
