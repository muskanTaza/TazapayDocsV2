| requires_action | The customer has not made the payment and further action is required from the customer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| processing      | The customer has performed all the actions but Tazapay is yet to receive the payment. It is very rare that a payment attempt using a particular payment method stays in this state unless the payment method chosen is not an instant one. For example, a payment attempt stays in the processing state when the payment method chosen is local bank transfer / wire transfer. Offline payments take some time for the intermediary banking institutions to process them. |
| succeeded       | The payment attempt is successful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
