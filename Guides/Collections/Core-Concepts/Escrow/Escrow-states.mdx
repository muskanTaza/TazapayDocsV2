| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unpaid     | The customer has not made the payment and further action is required from the customer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| processing | The customer has performed all the actions but Tazapay is yet to receive the payment. It is very rare that an escrow session stays in this state unless the payment method chosen is not an instant one. For example, an escrow session stays in the processing state when the payment method chosen is local bank transfer / wire transfer. Offline payments take some time for the intermediary banking institutions to process them. |
| paid       | The payment is successful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
