title: "Funding a Payout After Creation"
description: "You can create a payout with insufficient balance and fund it later"
---

Tazapay allows you to create a payout and fund it later. This is useful when you need to initiate payouts before funds are available in your account.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Payout Created] --> B{Contains FX?}
    
    B -->|No| C[requires_funding]
    B -->|Yes| D{Custom config?}
    
    C --> E[Waits 7 days]
    D -->|No| F[Fails immediately]
    D -->|Yes| G[requires_funding]
    
    G --> H[Waits configured duration]
    
    E --> I{Balance credited?}
    H --> I
    
    I -->|Yes| J{Auto-fund enabled?}
    I -->|No / Timeout| K[Payout Fails]
    
    J -->|Yes| L[Auto-funded via FIFO]
    J -->|No| M[Fund API selection]
    
    L --> N[Payout Processed]
    M --> N
```

## Default Behavior

| Payout Type | Default Behavior | Waiting Period |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Without FX | Moves to `requires_funding` | 7 days |
| With FX | Fails immediately | None (configurable) |

<Info>
Payouts without FX transactions automatically move to the `requires_funding` state and wait for 7 days before failing.
</Info>

<Warning>
Payouts containing FX transactions will fail immediately by default. You must enable the funding window configuration to allow deferred funding for FX payouts.
</Warning>

## Funding Mechanisms

### Automatic Funding (Default)

When your balance receives a credit, payouts in the `requires_funding` state are automatically funded using a **FIFO (First In, First Out)** mechanism based on creation time.

<Tip>
The FIFO mechanism ensures that your oldest pending payouts are funded first, maintaining fair processing order.
</Tip>

### Selective Funding via API

You can disable auto-funding and use the Fund API to selectively fund specific payouts. This gives you full control over which payouts get funded.

**Use cases for selective funding:**

- Your customers fund you after payout creation on your platform
- You need to prioritize certain payouts over others
- You want to match specific incoming funds to specific payouts

## Enabling FX Payout Funding Window

By default, payouts containing FX transactions fail immediately if there's insufficient balance. To enable a funding window for FX payouts:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Configuration">
    Specify the time duration you need for the funding window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Tazapay will configure the custom duration for your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
