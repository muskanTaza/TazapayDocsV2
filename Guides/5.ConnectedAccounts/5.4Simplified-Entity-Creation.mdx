title: "Simplified Entity Creation"
description: "Tazapay gathers minimal information about a client. It often involves lighter due diligence and minimal documentation to speed up access to Tazapay’s suite of services. Tazapay will soft-onboard entities only when it successfully evaluates the onboarding process of the entity’s platform/financial institution and deems it compliant. "

Typically, this will mean:

1. The platform / financial institution serves a very limited niche and has finetuned its onboarding requirements to serve the niche.

2. The platform / financial institution collects (or is able to provide upon request) at least all the information  which Tazapay would have access to if Tazapay had been the one performing the full onboarding.

With soft onboarding, the friction to use Tazapay reduces substantially. Please contact with [support@tazapay.com](mailto:support@tazapay.com) to understand if we can support your usecase via simplified entity creation.
