To process transactions, the ultimate remitter must be onboarded on Tazapay. We support both full and simplified onboarding flows, allowing faster go-live based on the use case and risk profile. Below are the two ways to onboard the ultimate remitter with Tazapay when the transactions are not first party.

### Sub-Accounts

Sub-Accounts are ideal if you want to onboard each customer as a separate Tazapay merchant and fully segregate funds. This model provides clearer reconciliation, individual balances, and greater transparency for platforms managing multiple independent businesses.

### Tazapay Entities

Tazapay Entities are suited for on-behalf-of payment models, where a single merchant account operates while executing payouts for multiple underlying parties.
