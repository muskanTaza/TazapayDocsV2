**Entities** are **individuals or businesses** that a platform can onboard on Tazapay to **create collections and payouts on their behalf**.

Entities do not integrate directly with Tazapay. Instead, they are **linked to the platform’s primary Tazapay account**, allowing the platform to facilitate payments **on behalf of these entities** while retaining centralized control.

## Why is this required ?

1. Regulatory Transparency
2. Strong Compliance & Risk Controls
3. Clear Fund Traceability
4. Enables Marketplace & Platform Use Cases
5. Bank & Partner Acceptance

## How  to create entities ?

Entity is not a generally available feature, please contact [support@tazapay.com](mailto:support@tazapay.com) to enable this feature if not enabled on your account. But if we discover that your usecase mandatorly requires you to create transactions on behalf of entities (For example - You work with nested flows), then we will be mandating entity creation alongside a transaction for your account.

 Entities can be created both via the dashboard and the API.

Refer entity API to create and submit entities .

### Dashboard
