title: "Entity Approval Lifecycle"
---

The entity approval cycle on Tazapay varies based on the merchant’s use case, risk profile, and regulatory requirements. As a result, entity workflows are configured differently for each merchant.

Depending on your setup, Tazapay may apply one of the following models:

#### 1. Pre-Approval Payouts Enabled

For lower-risk use cases, platforms may be allowed to:

- Create entities
- Initiate payouts **immediately after entity creation**
- Proceed without waiting for formal entity approval

This enables faster operations while still maintaining compliance records.

#### 2. Mandatory Entity Approval Required

For higher-risk or more regulated use cases:

- Each entity must undergo **mandatory review and approval**
- Payouts **cannot be initiated** until the entity is approved
- Approval ensures enhanced KYB/KYC, risk checks, and compliance validation

### Review Timeline

If your account is configured under the **mandatory entity approval** model:

- Tazapay’s compliance team will review the entity
- **Expected review timeline: within 3 business days**
