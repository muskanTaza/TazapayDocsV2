Sub-Accounts can be created under your main Tazapay account and are treated as fully independent, segregated accounts. Each Sub-Account has its own dedicated balances, settlements, and account-level configurations.

Every Sub-Account must complete KYB before it can start transacting.

Sub-Accounts are primarily used for fund segregation, such as when a business operates multiple legal entities across different countries, manages large merchants that need to be onboarded as separate merchants, or requires clean, independent reconciliation for each business or entity.

## Creating a Sub account 

You can only create a sub account via dashboard today.
