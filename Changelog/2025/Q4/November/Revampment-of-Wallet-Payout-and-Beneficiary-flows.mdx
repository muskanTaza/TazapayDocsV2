### **🔐 Travel Rule Compliant Wallet Payouts**

We’ve redesigned the wallet payout experience to ensure compliance with global Travel Rule regulations for all outgoing crypto transactions.
This revamp introduces new data fields, a state-based approval process and enhanced wallet verification ensuring that all crypto payouts are both secure and regulatorily compliant while maintaining transparency for your business and its beneficiaries.

### **🧩 Enhanced Beneficiary Object**

New fields have been added to the beneficiary and destination_details.wallet objects.
These updates ensure accurate capture of required Travel Rule data when creating wallet payouts—whether through the API or dashboard.

### 🧾 **Wallet Beneficiary State Management & Approvals**

Wallet beneficiaries now follow a state-based lifecycle with internal compliance approval for 1st-party wallets before payouts can be initiated.
You’ll receive email and webhook notifications for every wallet beneficiary creation and state transition.

### **🧠 Wallet Verification (Hosted vs. Self-Hosted)**

When adding a wallet beneficiary, you’ll now specify whether the wallet is:

* Hosted (on an exchange)
* Unhosted (self hosted wallets where you have control over private keys)

Depending on the wallet type:

* Hosted wallets require wallet screen recordings for verification.
* Self-hosted wallets require performing a cryptographic signature, which proves ownership of the wallet address by digitally signing a verification message with the private key.
  This step can currently be performed only via the Tazapay dashboard.

Until verification is complete, the wallet beneficiary will remain in the requires_action state and payouts will be restricted.
All of these wallet beneficiaries can be viewed under Dashboard → Action Required → Wallet Beneficiaries tab

### **👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

A new permission, “Allow Cryptographic Signature”, has been added under
Settings → Manage Team → Payout.

This permission controls who can perform cryptographic signatures.

All existing users have this enabled by default, but admins can restrict access as needed.
