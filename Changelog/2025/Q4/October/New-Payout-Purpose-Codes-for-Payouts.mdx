title: "New Payout Purpose Codes For Payouts"

To enhance the accuracy and classification of your transactions, we have added two new purpose codes to our Payouts API. These codes are now available for use when creating a payout.

The new codes are:

1. **PYR033**: Merchant Settlement
2. **PYR034**: Repatriation Fund Settlement
