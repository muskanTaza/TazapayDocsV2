title: "Bulgaria Currency Transition BGN EUR"
---
## Change Type

**Currency validation / acceptance**

## Region Impacted

**Bulgaria-related flows**

## Effective Date

**25 December 2025**

## Summary

To align with ISO 4217 updates and upstream FX/provider support, Tazapay will discontinue support for **BGN** and require **EUR** as the sole supported currency for Bulgaria-related transactions starting **25 December 2025**.

## What's Changing

### 1. Currency Acceptance for New Transactions

From **25 December 2025** onward, any new Bulgaria-related transaction using **BGN** will be rejected.

**EUR** will become the only accepted local currency for Bulgaria-related flows across:

* Collections
* Holding
* Checkout
* Payment links
* Pay-ins
* Payouts
* Settlements
* Refunds
* Adjustments

### 2. Historical Visibility

* Existing **BGN** transactions will remain visible in the dashboard and reports for historical reference.

## Developer Migration Guidance

### Required Action (for API Integrators)

* Update integration logic to ensure **EUR** is used for all Bulgaria-related transactions.
* If currency is passed via API parameters, ensure **BGN** is no longer used when the transaction is Bulgaria-linked.

### No Action Required

* Transactions already processed in **BGN** require no changes and will remain available for historical viewing and reporting.

## Backward Compatibility Notes

* This change affects **only new transaction creation** (and other “new action” flows) after the effective date.
* Reporting and dashboard access for historical **BGN** records remains unchanged.
