# Get Payout API Changes

The **Get Payout API** has been enhanced to provide additional details for payout reversal scenarios. A new payout state, **`reversed`**, has been introduced along with additional fields to improve traceability and visibility into reversal-related transactions and FX movements.

## New State Introduced

* **`reversed`**
  Indicates that a previously succeeded payout has been successfully reversed.

## New Fields Added

* **`reversal_balance_transaction`**  
  References the balance transaction created as part of the payout reversal.

* **`reversal_payout_fx_transaction`**  
  Represents the FX transaction applied during the payout-side reversal process.

For a detailed walkthrough of payout reversals, reconciliation, and merchant workflows, see the [**Payout Reversals** guide](https://docs.tazapay.com/docs/payout-reversal-overview).

# Fetch Balance Transaction API

Updates have been made to the fee representation for reversal transactions in the **Balance Transaction** object.

## Fee Structure Update

For reversal transactions, the API now returns **`third_party_fee`** instead of **`payout_fee`** in the **Fee** object.

| Field       | Behaviour       | Purpose                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fee_details | third_party_fee | Distinguishes third-party charges applied during payout reversals |

## FX Structure Update

For reversal transactions, the API now returns **`third_party_fx`** along with holding FX transactions in the **FX** object.

| Field          | Behaviour           | Purpose                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fx_conversions | third_party_fx      | Represents FX charges applied by third-party providers during reversals |
| fx_conversions | reversal_holding_fx | Represents the FX movement on the holding-currency side of a reversal   |

These updates provide clearer visibility into the fee components associated with reversed payouts.
