We are excited to announce a new addition to our payment collection methods. Merchants can now accept payments in Thai Baht (THB) from their customers in Thailand via WeChat Pay.

This integration allows you to tap into a massive customer base in Thailand by offering one of the region's most popular and trusted payment methods, directly through the Tazapay platform.

For a step-by-step guide on how to configure and use this new payment method, please see our comprehensive documentation.
