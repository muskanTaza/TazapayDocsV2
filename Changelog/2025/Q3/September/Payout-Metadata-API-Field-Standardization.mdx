title: "Payout Metadata API Field Standardization"
---
We have released an update to the Payout Bank Metadata API (`/v3/metadata/payout/bank`) to standardize field names and introduce a more structured format for addresses. This update includes **breaking changes** that will require action on your part.

These changes will improve data consistency, reduce errors, and allow for more robust validation.

***

### **Breaking Changes**

To continue using the Payout API without interruption, you **must update your integration** to adopt the following new field names and structures.

| Old Field / Structure          | New Field / Structure              | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address` (as a single string) | `address` (as a structured object) | The address is no longer a single string. It is now a structured object with fields like `address.line1`, `address.city`, `address.state`, and `address.postal_code`. |
| `postcode`                     | `postal_code`                      | The field for the postal code has been renamed for consistency.                                                                                                       |
| `phone.contact_code`           | `phone.calling_code`               | The field for the phone country code has been renamed.                                                                                                                |
| `phone.contact_number`         | `phone.number`                     | The field for the local phone number has been renamed.                                                                                                                |

### **:rocket: Enhancement**

We've also introduced an enhancement to help you prepare for future improvements.

* **New `recommended_fields` Object:** The API response now includes a `recommended_fields` object. This will list optional fields that are not part of the primary requirement.
* **Important Note:** We have introduced `recommended_fields` to accommodate our expanding network of payment providers. **The number of providers available for routing depends on the number of fields specified from the recommended_fields parameter for a given beneficiary**

***

### **Action Required**

* You must update your integration to parse the new, structured `address` object and use the updated field names (`postal_code`, `calling_code`, `number`).
