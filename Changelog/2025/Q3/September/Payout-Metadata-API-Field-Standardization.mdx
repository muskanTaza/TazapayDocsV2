title: "Payout Metadata API Field Standardization"
---

We have released an update to the Payout Bank Metadata API (`/v3/metadata/payout/bank`) to standardize field names and introduce a more structured format for addresses. This update includes **breaking changes** that will require action on your part.

These changes will improve data consistency, reduce errors, and allow for more robust validation.

***

### Breaking Changes

To continue using the Payout API without interruption, you **must update your integration** to adopt the following new field names and structures.

| Old Field / Structure          | New Field / Structure              | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `address` (string)             | `address` (object)                 | Address is now structured |
| `postcode`                     | `postal_code`                      | Renamed for consistency |
| `phone.contact_code`           | `phone.calling_code`               | Renamed |
| `phone.contact_number`         | `phone.number`                     | Renamed |

***

### 🚀 Enhancement

* **New `recommended_fields` Object**
* Routing availability depends on the number of recommended fields provided.

***

### Action Required

* Update your integration to parse structured `address`
* Use updated field names
