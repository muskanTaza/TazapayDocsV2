# Integration Steps

## Step 1: Set up your Tazapay account

Before integrating Tazapay Checkout, ensure you have a Tazapay account. [Sign up](https://dashboard.tazapay.com/) if you haven't already.

## Step 2: Create a Checkout Session

The Checkout Session is the core concept in Tazapay Checkout. It contains all the details about the transaction, such as the amount, currency, customer details and the payment methods.

Specify the payment method the customer selected in the field `payment_methods`.

> **Payment Method Nomenclature**
>
> Each payment method is represented by a unique string in Tazapay. The name for a payment method is the combination of the payment method name and the currency in which the customer is charged. For example, the name for Paynow in Singapore is `paynow_sgd`

### Sample cURL

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://service-sandbox.tazapay.com/v3/checkout \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'authorization: Basic YWtfdGVzaF9ZTFNVQUUwVjRCSEpIOFg0ODZPQzpza190ZXN0X0hNOEM3SEVSV1BmODVPZnFCMXhLTUJJMWlENnVWYTEyUWN2VE5ZeVJhSHhRZjVTOW9pZUtoOVZzejg3cnhtSEpaSlcyTHdVc0NSY2RWbUR0d0U4Q0VkdWNIUXRnNVQzVjl1NkltQWludkdiMjhWeXhTVVlsTTFMWWllbU80THFt' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "customer_details": {
      "name": "Andrea Lark",
      "email": "[email protected]",
      "country": "VN"
    },
    "invoice_currency": "USD",
    "amount": 10000,
    "transaction_description": "1 x T-shirt",
    "payment_methods":["bank_push_vnd"]
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Redirect customers to Tazapay checkout

Calling the checkout API in Step 2 provides the following response. Redirect the customer to Tazapay's hosted payment page using the URL.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "status": "success",
    "message": "",
    "data": {
      "amount": 10000,
      "amount_paid": 0,
      "billing_details": null,
      "cancel_url": "",
      "created_at": "2024-07-19T10:11:07.832914998Z",
      "customer": "cus_cq8i3c4j2pdpn2r2lah0",
      "customer_details": {
        "country": "VN",
        "email": "[email protected]",
        "name": "Andrea Lark",
        "phone": {
          "calling_code": "",
          "number": ""
        }
      },
      "customer_fee_percentage": 0,
      "expires_at": null,
      "holding_currency": "USD",
      "id": "chk_cqd3nep5ct0u7aakeco0",
      "invoice_currency": "USD",
      "items": [],
      "latest_payment_attempt": "",
      "metadata": null,
      "object": "checkout",
      "paid_in_excess": false,
      "partially_paid": false,
      "payin": "chk_cqd3nep5ct0u7aakeco0",
      "payment_attempts": [],
      "payment_methods": [
        "bank_push_vnd"
      ],
      "payment_status": "unpaid",
      "payment_status_description": "",
      "reference_id": "",
      "remove_payment_methods": [],
      "shipping_details": null,
      "statement_descriptor": "",
      "status": "active",
      "success_url": "",
      "token": "tGxhgHg5USrT3Gizxu-aL-GFF5FhyaCT4KHyXQXcxZE=",
      "transaction_data": [],
      "transaction_description": "1 x T-shirt",
      "transaction_documents": [],
      "url": "https://checkout-sandbox.tazapay.com/transaction/tGxhgHg5USrT3Gizxu-aL-GFF5FhyaCT4KHyXQXcxZE=",
      "webhook_url": ""
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Handle post-payment events

Tazapay sends events to your webhook endpoint to notify you about changes in the Checkout Session status. Set up a webhook endpoint to handle events like checkout.paid.
