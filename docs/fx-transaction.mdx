### Key Aspects of FX Transactions

* **Currency Conversion:** FX transactions facilitate the conversion of funds from one currency to another, enabling cross-border payments and transactions.
* **Exchange Rate:** The exchange rate is the rate at which one currency is exchanged for another. It may fluctuate in real-time based on market conditions.
* **Currency Pairs:** In FX transactions, currencies are traded in pairs, such as USD/EUR (US Dollar/Euro) or USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen).
