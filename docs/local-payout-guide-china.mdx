# Important Note

1. When creating a beneficiary via the Create Beneficiary API, ensure the `national_identification_number` is provided for individual beneficiaries. Failure to do so will result in payout creation failure. You will need to add a new beneficiary with the required information.
2. Similarly. if the payout is created for an individual, we will need the company name to which they are associated in order to process. In addition, we will need them to share additional docs as well.
