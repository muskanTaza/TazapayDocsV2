### What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and why is it required?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your Tazapay account by requiring more than just your password to access your account or perform sensitive actions. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

MFA is mandatory for all Tazapay accounts. Users had 45 days post-launch to set it up before it became compulsory.

***

### When will I be asked to complete MFA?

You will need to complete MFA:

* At login
* When performing sensitive or high-risk actions

***

### How do I set up MFA on my Tazapay account?

The setup is simple and mandatory:

1. On your next login, you'll be prompted to set up MFA.

2. Choose your preferred method:

   * Passkey (recommended for best security and convenience)
   * SMS code
   * Authenticator app (TOTP)

3. Complete the verification process.

4. Save your recovery codes securely.

You can also set up MFA in **Account Settings > Security > Multi-Factor Authentication**.

***

### What MFA methods can I use?

* Passkey (Recommended): Uses Face ID, fingerprint, or screen lock. No code entry needed.
* SMS Code: Receives a 6-digit code via text. Ensure your phone number is up to date.
* Authenticator App (TOTP): Works offline. Apps like Google Authenticator, 1Password, or Authy generate a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds.
* Recovery Codes: One-time use codes shown during setup. Store securely in an offline location. Only use them when you cannot access any method of authentication.

***

### Can I manage or change my MFA settings later?

Yes! Go to **Settings > Security > Multi-Factor Authentication** in your Tazapay dashboard to:

* Add or remove passkeys
* Update your SMS number
* Change your default method
* Set up or replace your authenticator app
* View or regenerate recovery codes

***

### What if I lose access to my MFA method?

* Use your recovery codes.
* If recovery codes are also unavailable, contact Tazapay support immediately at [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d6a5a3a6a6b9a4a296a2b7acb7a6b7aff8b5b9bb).

***

### What are the best practices for MFA?

* Set up at least two MFA methods to reduce the risk of lockout.
* Store recovery codes offline and securely.
* Use Passkeys for the best balance of security and convenience.

***

### Do I have to set up MFA immediately?

MFA is required for all accounts, but users initially had 45 days post-launch to complete setup before it became mandatory.

***

### When are we launching MFA ?

MFA should be live by 21 July, 2025
