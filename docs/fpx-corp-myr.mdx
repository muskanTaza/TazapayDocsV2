# How It Works

* During online checkout, customers select FPX as their payment method.
* They are then redirected to a secure FPX page where they choose their preferred bank from a list of participating Malaysian banks (which includes most major banks like Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank, and many others).
* Customers log in to their online banking portal using their existing bank credentials.
* They review the payment details (amount and payee) and authorize the transaction, often requiring a second-factor authentication method like a One-Time Password (OTP).
* Once the payment is authorized, the funds are debited from the customer's bank account in real-time, and both the customer and the merchant receive a payment confirmation.

# Payment Method type
