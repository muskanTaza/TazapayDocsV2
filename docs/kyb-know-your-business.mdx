Know Your Business (KYB) is an integral part of the onboarding process before any merchant can fully utilise Tazapay's services.

KYB is an identity verification regulatory requirement that all financial service providers need to fulfil in order to prevent money laundering to take place in their payments ecosystem. As a payments platform, Tazapay would need to have identity verification of all owners and beneficiaries of a business that have a more than 25% stake in the company.

<Info>
  To learn more about why KYB is required, feel free to check out our [FAQ](https://support.tazapay.com/why-is-it-important-to-complete-my-kyc-kyb-process).
</Info>

You will be prompted to complete your KYB as soon as you create an account (or add a business) on Tazapay.
