Using the [checkout API](https://docs.tazapay.com/v3/reference/create-checkout), you can also list the available payment methods for a session on a screen hosted by you.

The customer selects the payment method from your screen first and are directly redirected to the page where an action is expected of them.

#### Example:

Suppose there are two payment methods available for a checkout session (Cards and Paynow QR). You can display the payment methods Card and Paynow QR for your customer to select. If the customer selects Paynow QR, you can create a checkout session with the field `payment_methods` containing the value `paynow_sgd`. The URL returned in the response body of the checkout API will display the QR code directly to the customer on redirection.

#### Sample Request Body:
