| processing | The customer has performed all the actions but Tazapay is yet to receive the payment. It is very rare that a checkout session stays in this state unless the payment method chosen is not an instant one. For example, a checkout session stays in the processing state when the payment method chosen is local bank transfer / wire transfer. Offline payments take some time for the intermediary banking institutions to process them. |
| paid       | The payment for the checkout session is successful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
