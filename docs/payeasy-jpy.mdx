# How It Works

While both PayEasy and PayEasy Cash are payment options in Japan, they refer to slightly different ways a consumer can use the PayEasy system to complete a transaction:

**PayEasy (General)**

* This is the overarching payment service that allows consumers to pay for online purchases, bills, and other services conveniently through various channels.

* **Payment Channels:** PayEasy offers two main ways for consumers to pay:

  * **ATM Payment:** Using a payment number provided by the merchant, the consumer can go to a participating bank ATM and pay using cash or their ATM card.
  * **Online Banking Payment:** The consumer can select PayEasy during online checkout, choose their bank, and complete the payment directly through their online banking interface.

**PayEasy Cash**

* This specifically refers to the **ATM payment method within the broader PayEasy system where the consumer uses cash to make the payment.**

* **How it Works:**

  * The consumer receives a unique payment number (including a recipient number, customer number, and confirmation number) from the online merchant or biller.
  * They visit a participating bank ATM that displays the PayEasy logo.
  * They select the "Pay-easy" or "Tax & Fee Payment" option on the ATM.
  * They enter the required numbers (recipient number, customer number, confirmation number).
  * They confirm the payment details displayed on the screen.
  * They select "Cash" as the payment method and insert the required amount into the ATM.
  * The ATM issues a receipt as proof of payment.
