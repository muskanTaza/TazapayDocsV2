# How It Works

* Users download the DANA application and register using their mobile phone number.
* They can top up their DANA balance through various methods, including bank transfers (virtual accounts), ATM, debit/credit cards, and at a wide network of partner retail outlets (e.g., Alfamart, Lawson).
* Once funded, users can make payments for a wide array of services both online and offline. This includes payments at participating merchants (using QR codes, including QRIS), for e-commerce transactions, bill payments (utilities, telecommunications), mobile top-ups, and even for investments and insurance through integrated features.
* DANA also facilitates peer-to-peer transfers to other DANA users and allows cash withdrawals from their DANA balance at select retail partners.
