* Primarily used for seamless and secure payments for purchases on the Shopee platform, often accompanied by exclusive discounts and Shopee Coins cashback.
* Increasingly used for offline payments at participating merchants by scanning QR codes (including QRIS, the national standard) with the Shopee app.
