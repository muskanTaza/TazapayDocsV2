Tazapay’s payout product leverages two primary methods for transferring funds: domestic bank transfers and SWIFT transfers. Local bank or domestic transfers involve sending funds directly to a recipient's local bank account in their native currency, often providing faster processing times and lower fees. On the other hand, SWIFT transfers offer a global network for transferring funds between banks worldwide, enabling transactions in various currencies.

Tazapay enables businesses and individuals to convert and send money to beneficiaries in over 100 currencies using [a single API](https://docs.tazapay.com/reference/create-payout). Whether it's dispersing salaries to international employees, making payments to freelancers overseas, or sending money to international vendors, Tazapay’s payout product offers a streamlined solution for cross-border transactions.
