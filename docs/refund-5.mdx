## Refund Overview

A refund is a reversal of a payment transaction, returning the funds to the customer. This can occur under several circumstances:

* **Cancelled Order**: A refund is issued if the buyer cancels the order before it's fulfilled.
* **Product Return**: If a buyer returns a product due to dissatisfaction or a defect, a refund is processed.
* **Failed Transaction**: Refunds are automatically initiated if a payment fails due to technical issues, insufficient funds, or other reasons.
* **Disputed Transaction**: When a payment dispute or chargeback is raised, a refund may be issued pending resolution.
* **Overpayment**: If a buyer overpays or makes duplicate payments, the excess amount is refunded.

Tazapay processes refunds back to the original payment method used by the buyer.

## Types of Refunds

* **Full Refund**: The entire transaction amount is returned to the customer.
* **Partial Refund**: Only a specific portion of the transaction amount is returned, not exceeding the total originally paid.

## Initiating Refunds

Refunds can only be initiated by the merchant. This request can be done in two ways:
