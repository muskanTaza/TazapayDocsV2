title: "Checkout"
description: "Checkout is used to initiate a checkout session on your store or marketplace. This enables you to collect cross-border payments from your buyers in their local currencies using cards and a variety of local payment methods. You can also choose which payment methods to be shown to the customer for payment."

We recommend creating a session each time your customer attempts to pay. This will generate a transaction number which will be unique to each session. You and your customer can use this as a reference for future purposes. You can use this number for all after the payment operations including refunds, reconciliation, raising other queries etc.
