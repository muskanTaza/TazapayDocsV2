### Checkout Lifecycle

A customer's checkout experience looks like this:

1. When customers are ready with the goods/services and would like to complete their purchase, your application creates a new Checkout session.
2. Tazapay returns a 'url' as a response to your application's creation of a Checkout session.
3. Your application redirects the customers to the 'url' which is a Tazapay-hosted payment page, where the customers complete their payment.
4. After the completion of the payment process, Tazapay returns the customer back to your application.
5. Tazapay sends [webhooks](https://docs.tazapay.com/docs/checkout-webhook) about the [state](https://docs.tazapay.com/docs/checkout-object-states) of the transaction and payment details directly to your application so that you can handle fulfilment.
