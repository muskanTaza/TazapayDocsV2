# After Collection

You can choose to do the following with the funds in your collection accounts:

1. **Receive Settlements:** After collection, Tazapay converts and transfers the collected funds to the bank account and currency of your choice on a periodic basis. This is the default configuration for your account.
2. **Make Payouts:** You can choose to make payouts to third-parties in 60+ currencies using the collected funds. You can reach out to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fc8f898c8c938e88bc889d869d8c9d85d29f9391) to disable auto-settlements and enable payouts for your account.
