# How It Works

* **Standardization:** QRIS establishes a single QR code that can be used by all participating payment service providers (PSPs), including banks, e-wallets, and fintech companies.
* **Merchant Display:** Merchants only need to display one QRIS code, eliminating the clutter of multiple QR codes from different payment platforms.
* **User Scanning:** Consumers can use any QRIS-enabled payment application on their smartphones (e.g., GoPay, OVO, Dana, LinkAja, ShopeePay, and mobile banking apps from various banks) to scan the merchant's QRIS code.
* **Payment Initiation:** After scanning, the user enters the payment amount (for static QR codes) or the amount is pre-filled (for dynamic QR codes).
* **Confirmation and Transfer:** The user reviews the transaction details and confirms the payment within their chosen mobile payment application. Funds are then transferred in near real-time from the consumer's account to the merchant's account, regardless of the underlying payment service providers used by each party.
