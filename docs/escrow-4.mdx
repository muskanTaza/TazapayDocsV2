title: "Escrow"
description: "Escrow allows your customers to protect their funds until certain conditions are met, typically, the delivery of goods/services. The verification of goods/service delivery is done by Tazapay."

Escrow is similar to checkout with the only difference that you have to upload documents such as invoices and proof of shipment/service delivery before Tazapay can settle the funds to your bank account. This option is useful when you are dealing with new buyers or high value transactions, to give your buyers more comfort that comes with this protection
