## 📝 What is Tazapay's Payment Gateway API?

The Tazapay APIs allow you to collect, hold and release payments for cross-border transactions from multiple countries.

## Get Started

To get your live mode API keys and also gain access to payment links, please follow these steps:

1. Sign up to [Tazapay's dashboard](https://dashboard.tazapay.com/)
2. Verify your email address from your inbox.
3. The next step is to fill the KYB form so that Tazapay can learn more about you and your business. You can do so by clicking on `Complete Now` on the homepage

4. After Tazapay receives your KYB application, it takes Tazapay 2-3 business days to approve your account.
5. After your account is approved, you can fetch your API keys by navigating to `Settings` --> `API Keys & Developer Docs`. These API keys will help you access Tazapay API.
