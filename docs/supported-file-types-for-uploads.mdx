* **.tar** **(Tape Archive)**: A common archive format that bundles multiple files into one, often used in conjunction with compression formats.
* **.gz** **(Gzip)**: A file format used for data compression, typically used to compress single files. Often combined with `.tar` to create `.tar.gz` archives.
* **.bz2** **(Bzip2):** Another file format used for data compression, generally offering higher compression ratios than Gzip but with slower compression speed. Often combined with `.tar` to create `.tar.bz2` archives.
* **.xz**: A lossless data compression format that generally achieves higher compression ratios than both Gzip and Bzip2. Often combined with `.tar` to create `.tar.xz` archives.
* **.7z** **(7-Zip)**: A high-compression archive format known for its high compression ratio and strong encryption.
* **.rar** **(Roshal Archive)**: A proprietary archive file format that also supports data compression, error recovery, and file spanning.
