# How It Works

* During online checkout, customers selecting P24 are presented with a comprehensive list of payment options.

* These options typically include:

  * **Fast Bank Transfers ("Pay-by-link"):** Direct debits from the customer's bank account, similar to FPX or iDEAL, where the customer is redirected to their bank's secure environment to authorize the payment. P24 supports a vast majority of Polish banks.
  * **BLIK:** Poland's popular mobile payment system, allowing users to pay with a short-lived code generated by their banking app.
  * **Payment Cards (Credit/Debit):** Visa, Mastercard, and other popular card schemes.
  * **Mobile Payments:** Including options like Masterpass and Visa Checkout.
  * **Traditional Bank Transfers:** Generating details for a standard bank transfer that the customer can complete manually.
  * **e-Wallets:** Integration with popular e-wallets.
  * **Cash Payments at Retail Locations ("PayPoC"):** Allowing customers to generate a code and pay in cash at designated retail outlets.
  * **Installment Payments:** Facilitating "buy now, pay later" options.

* Once the customer selects their preferred method and completes the payment process within P24's secure environment or their chosen payment provider's platform, P24 confirms the transaction to the online merchant.
