# How it Works?

* Users download the official mobile banking application(s) provided by their respective banks (e.g., Bangkok Bank Mobile Banking, SCB EASY, Krungsri Mobile App, K PLUS by Kasikornbank).

* They register and securely log in using credentials such as usernames, passwords, and increasingly, biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition).

* Once logged in, users can access a wide array of banking services directly from their mobile devices, including:

  * **Account Overview:** Viewing real-time balances and transaction history for all linked accounts (savings, current, credit cards, loans).
  * **Fund Transfers:** Transferring money to other accounts within the same bank or to accounts in other banks via various methods like PromptPay, account number, or QR code.
  * **Bill Payments:** Paying a wide range of bills, including utilities (electricity, water), telecommunications, credit cards, and government services.
  * **Mobile Top-ups:** Recharging prepaid mobile phone credit for themselves or others.
  * **Investment Services:** Accessing information and potentially managing investments in mutual funds or other financial products offered by the bank.
