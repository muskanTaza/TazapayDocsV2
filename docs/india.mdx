# How it Works?

* UPI enables seamless and instant fund transfers between two bank accounts using a virtual payment address (VPA), mobile number, or QR code.
* Users link their bank accounts to one or more UPI-enabled mobile applications (provided by banks or third-party providers like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm).
* A user initiates a payment request through their UPI app by entering the recipient's VPA, mobile number (linked to a bank account via UPI), or by scanning a UPI QR code.
* The payment is authenticated using a secure PIN (UPI PIN) set by the user for their linked bank account.
* Once authenticated, the funds are instantly debited from the sender's account and credited to the recipient's account in real-time.
