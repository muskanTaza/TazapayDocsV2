<Info>
  **Minor Unit:** The minor unit of a currency refers to the number of digits after the decimal separator that the currency can have.
</Info>

All the currencies have distinct minor units, either 0, 2, 3 or 4. The entire list can be accessed [here](https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/financial-information/data-center/iso-currrency/lists/list-one.xls).

The `amount` key for will always accept the denomination value with 2 decimal places in an integer format.

**Example:** Consider three currencies, a 3 decimal currency KWD, a 2 decimal currency INR and a 0 decimal currency JPY.

* For INR, if you want the amount to be 100.89, you pass 10089 as the value for the amount key.
* For JPY, if you want the amount to be 100, you pass 10000. The last 2 digits will always be considered as 0 even if the values are different than 0.
* For KWD, if you want the amount to be 100.899, you can pass 10089 as the value for the amount key. Tazapayâ€™s system will not accept the third decimal place of 3 digit currencies. If you pass 100899, it will be considered as KWD 1008.990.
