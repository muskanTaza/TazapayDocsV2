# How the Payin API works

## Lifecycle of a payin

1. **Create a Payin:** Begin by creating a Payin on your server. This specifies the amount, currency, and other details of the payment.
2. **Confirm the Payin:** Confirm the Payin on your server/client-side, potentially requiring customer authentication.
3. **Complete the Payment:** Handle post-payment activities based on the payment outcome.
