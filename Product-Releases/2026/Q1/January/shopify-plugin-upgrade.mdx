We’ve released an updated version of the Tazapay Shopify plugin with improvements focused on making setup and testing easier for merchants before going live.

## What’s new

### 1) Sandbox environment support
Merchants can now test and simulate payment flows using Sandbox accounts before enabling production payments. This helps validate end-to-end checkout behavior and reduces risk during go-live.

### 2) Custom payment method icons in production
The plugin now supports configuring custom payment method icons in the production application, improving visibility and consistency of the payment option shown at checkout.

If you have questions or need help testing your setup in sandbox, please reach out to our support team.
