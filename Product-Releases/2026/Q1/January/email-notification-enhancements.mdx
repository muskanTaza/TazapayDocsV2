We have released an update to Tazapay’s email notification system that gives you greater control over how, when, and where notifications are received. The goal is to ensure notifications reach the right stakeholders while reducing unnecessary noise.

## What's New

### **1) User-Level Notification Preferences**

Previously, notification settings were applied at the account level, meaning changes affected all users.

With this update:

- Each user can manage their own email notification preferences
- Changes made by one user do not impact other users on the same account
- This is especially useful when different teams manage different workflows across the same account

You can find these settings under **Settings → Account Notifications**.

### **2) Event-Based Notification Controls**

Users can now subscribe to specific events instead of receiving notifications for every activity.

For example:

- Disable notifications for every successful payout
- Receive alerts only when a payout requires action
- Configure notifications based on relevance and urgency

This helps reduce inbox clutter and ensures users receive only actionable notifications.

### **3) Add Email Recipients Without Dashboard Access**

You can now add email recipients who are not Tazapay dashboard users, such as shared inboxes or team email IDs.

For example:

- Route refund-related notifications to [refunds@company.com](mailto:refunds@company.com)
- Ensure operational alerts reach a shared finance or operations inbox

This allows notifications to be delivered directly to the right teams without requiring dashboard access.
