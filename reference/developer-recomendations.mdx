> Tazapay recommends creating a checkout session (using the POST /v3/checkout endpoint) as soon as you have the necessary data from the customer (name, country and email). This reduces the time to load Tazapay's UI component for the customer.

## Reduce the wait time for your customers

Use preloading to load payment module in advance and reduce wait time for users.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  window.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
    
    //Preload tazapay payment UI as soon as the document loads 
    window.tazapay.preload(); // no arg required here 
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  //Call below method only once the clientToken is available 
  const options: {
    clientToken: "...",
  }
  window.tazapay.checkout(options);
  ```
</CodeGroup>
