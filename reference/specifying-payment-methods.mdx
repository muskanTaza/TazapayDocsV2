title: "Specifying Payment Methods"
description: "You can choose to host your own payment listing screen and use Tazapayâ€™s UI component to display and collect information for particular payment methods. You can do this by  while creating a checkout session."

> If you choose to select only one payment method for a transaction, the UI component will not show the payment methods selection screen to your customer and will directly ask them to enter the payment details, thus minimising the number of customer clicks to complete a payment.
