# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Tazapay account.

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify your application when specific events happen, such as:

- Payment completed
- Entity approved
- Payout processed
- Transaction status changes

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Configure your webhook URL in the Tazapay dashboard
2. Implement an endpoint to receive POST requests
3. Verify webhook signatures for security
4. Process events and respond with 200 OK

## Webhook Payload

All webhooks include:
- `event_type` - Type of event
- `data` - Event-specific data
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred

## Example Webhook

```json
{
  "event_type": "payout.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "payout_123",
    "status": "completed",
    "amount": 10000
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Security

Always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are from Tazapay.
