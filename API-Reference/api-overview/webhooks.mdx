Webhook Endpoints are setup on an account level from the dashboard as that gives users an interface to look at any successful or failed webhooks requests and also re-trigger them if required. Use this [guide](https://docs.tazapay.com/docs/webhooks-guides#/) to setup webhooks.

It is necessary that you configure your endpoint URL to acknowledge Tazapay's webhooks with standard HTTP Codes.
For example, pass 2xx for a successful POST request receipt on your server.

If Tazapay does not receive a 2xx acknowledgement, it will retry sending webhooks to the endpoint for a period of 24 hours. Click [here](/API-Reference/appendix/webhooks-retry-policy) for the detailed retry policy.

<Info title="Not receiving webhooks?">
In case of any server block or not receiving a response to your webhook URL, try whitelisting the below IP addresses:
- Test Mode (Sandbox): **13.213.226.109**
- Live Mode (Production): **52.77.198.235**
