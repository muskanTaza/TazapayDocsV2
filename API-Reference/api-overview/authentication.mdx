# Authentication

The Tazapay API uses HTTP Basic Authentication for all API requests.

## API Credentials

You'll need:
- **API Key** - Your unique identifier
- **API Secret** - Your secret key

## How to Authenticate

Include your credentials in the `Authorization` header using Basic Auth:

```bash
Authorization: Basic base64(api_key:api_secret)
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl https://service-sandbox.tazapay.com/v3/payout \
  -u YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose credentials** in client-side code
2. **Use environment variables** to store credentials
3. **Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
4. **Use HTTPS** for all API calls

## Testing Authentication

Use the sandbox environment to test your authentication setup before going live.
