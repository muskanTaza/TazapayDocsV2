title: "QR Php"
---
It is a rapidly growing and government-backed method for facilitating digital payments using Quick Response (QR) codes.

# How It Works

* **QR Ph Standard:** The Philippines has adopted a national QR code standard called **QR Ph**, based on the Europay-Mastercard-VISA (EMV) standard for secure payments. This ensures interoperability between different banks and e-wallets.
* **Scanning:** Users with accounts at participating banks or e-money issuers (EMIs) can use their mobile banking or e-wallet applications to scan QR Ph codes displayed by merchants or other individuals.
* **Payment Initiation:** After scanning, the app typically prompts the user to enter the payment amount (for static QR codes) or the amount is pre-filled (for dynamic QR codes).
* **Confirmation:** The user reviews the transaction details and confirms the payment within their mobile app, often using a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition for security.
* **Instant Transfer:** Funds are typically transferred in near real-time between the payer's and the recipient's accounts.
