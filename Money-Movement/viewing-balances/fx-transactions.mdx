title: "FX Transactions"

FX transactions allow you to convert funds between your enabled holding currencies.

This gives you flexibility to:
- Convert balances only when required
- Optimize FX timing and rates
- Support payouts in currencies different from collection currencies

## How FX Transactions Work
Currently, FX transactions are handled via an assisted flow.

To request an FX conversion:

- Contact [support@tazapay.com](mailto:support@tazapay.com), or
- Reach out to your Tazapay Account Manager

Once executed
- Funds are debited from the source holding currency
- Converted funds are credited to the destination holding currency
- FX details appear in your transaction history

### Important Notes
- Multiple holding currencies can be configured per account but there would always be only one primary holding currency
- Auto-conversion applies only when incoming funds do not match any enabled holding currency
- FX transactions are available only between enabled holding currencies
- Currency availability may vary based on compliance and region
- Large FX conversions may require additional checks
