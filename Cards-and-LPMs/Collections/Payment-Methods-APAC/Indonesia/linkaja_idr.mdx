title: "Linkaja Idr"

It is a state-owned digital payment platform and e-wallet in Indonesia, formed through the consolidation of e-money services from several state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including Telkomsel (TCASH), Bank Mandiri (e-cash), and BNI (Yap!).

# How It Works

* Users download the LinkAja application and register using their mobile phone number.
* They can top up their LinkAja balance through various channels, including bank transfers, ATM, mobile banking, and at a wide network of partner retail outlets (e.g., Indomaret, Alfamart).
* Once funded, users can make payments for a wide range of services both online and offline. This includes payments for transportation (e.g., Gojek), at participating merchants (using QR codes or the LinkAja app), for bill payments (utilities, government services), mobile top-ups, and even for remittances and other financial services.
* LinkAja also supports peer-to-peer transfers to other LinkAja users.
* Being state-backed, LinkAja often plays a key role in government-related digital payment initiatives and aims to serve a broad segment of the Indonesian population, including those in more remote areas.
