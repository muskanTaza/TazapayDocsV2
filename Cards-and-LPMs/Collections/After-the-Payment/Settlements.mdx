Receive funds from Tazapay in your bank account

Tazapay makes settlements to your <a href="https://developer.tazapay.com/Cards-and-LPMs/Collections/Core-Concepts/Bank-Accounts-and-Reconciliation" target="_blank">bank account</a>. By default, new users signing up for Tazapay will receive their settlement in a weekly cycle. The day in which you receive your settlement would depend on when you sign up for your Tazapay account. For eg: signing up on a Tuesday would mean you will receive your weekly settlement on Tuesdays. However, you write to us at [support@tazapay.com](mailto:support@tazapay.com) to receive payouts on the day of your choosing.

In some cases, you might receive an email asking you to upload documents. This is Tazapay taking necessary risk mitigation measures to keep the network safe. You can reply to the email with the documents or upload it from the dashboard.
