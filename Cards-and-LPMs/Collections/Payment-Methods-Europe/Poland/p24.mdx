**Przelewy24 (P24):** A leading online payment gateway in Poland, offering a wide array of payment methods to facilitate online transactions.

# How It Works

- During online checkout, customers selecting P24 are presented with a comprehensive list of payment options.
- These options typically include:
  - **Fast Bank Transfers ("Pay-by-link"):** Direct debits from the customer's bank account, similar to FPX or iDEAL, where the customer is redirected to their bank's secure environment to authorize the payment. P24 supports a vast majority of Polish banks.
  - **BLIK:** Poland's popular mobile payment system, allowing users to pay with a short-lived code generated by their banking app.
  - **Payment Cards (Credit/Debit):** Visa, Mastercard, and other popular card schemes.
  - **Mobile Payments:** Including options like Masterpass and Visa Checkout.
  - **Traditional Bank Transfers:** Generating details for a standard bank transfer that the customer can complete manually.
  - **e-Wallets:** Integration with popular e-wallets.
  - **Cash Payments at Retail Locations ("PayPoC"):** Allowing customers to generate a code and pay in cash at designated retail outlets.
  - **Installment Payments:** Facilitating "buy now, pay later" options.
- Once the customer selects their preferred method and completes the payment process within P24's secure environment or their chosen payment provider's platform, P24 confirms the transaction to the online merchant.
