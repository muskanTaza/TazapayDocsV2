Add a low-code cross-border payment page to your website, online shop or marketplace.

### Checkout Lifecycle

A customer's checkout experience looks like this:

1. When customers are ready with the goods/services and would like to complete their purchase, your application creates a new Checkout session.
2. Tazapay returns a 'url' as a response to your application's creation of a Checkout session.
3. Your application redirects the customers to the 'url' which is a Tazapay-hosted payment page, where the customers complete their payment.
4. After the completion of the payment process, Tazapay returns the customer back to your application.
5. Tazapay sends webhooks about the state of the transaction and payment details directly to your application so that you can handle fulfilment.
