# How It Works

* DOKU provides a wide array of payment methods, including e-wallets, bank transfers (virtual accounts), credit/debit cards, convenience store payments, and even QR codes (QRIS).
* For online transactions, DOKU acts as a payment gateway, seamlessly integrating with e-commerce platforms to offer various payment options to customers during checkout.
* Users can also utilize the DOKU e-wallet for online and offline payments after topping up their balance via bank transfer, ATM, or at partner retail outlets. Payments via the e-wallet often involve using login credentials and a password or PIN.
* DOKU also supports QRIS (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard), the national QR code standard, allowing users to make payments by scanning QR codes with their preferred mobile payment application.
