title: "Creating Sub-Accounts"
description: "A sub-account represents the platform's end customer who is onboarded as a separate account"

## Key Characteristics

- The end customer has their own account on Tazapay  
- Funds flow do not impact your platform’s balance, it directly impacts the customer's balance   
- Your platform acts as an orchestrator, not a funds holder  

## When This Model Is Typically Used

- You do not want to be in the flow of funds  
- You want clear separation of balances  
- Regulatory or licensing constraints require this  

## Operationally, How This Works

- Your platform can initiate payouts for the sub-account using the dashboard or API 
- The sub-account remains the economic owner and beneficiary of funds  
- Compliance, reporting, and settlement are tied directly to the sub-account  
- Tazapay treats the sub-account as the primary party for regulatory purposes  

## Onboarding and Approval

- Each sub-account undergoes a full onboarding flow  
- Only businesses can be onboarded as sub-accounts. This [link](/Global-Money-Movement/appendix/onboarding-requirements/onboarding-requirements-businesses) contains the onboarding requirements.
- Sub-accounts are subject to Tazapay approval before becoming active  

Once approved, the sub-account operates independently for collections and payouts.
