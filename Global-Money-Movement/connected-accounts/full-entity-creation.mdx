Full Entity Onboarding is a process where Tazapay performs complete onboarding and verification of an entity, either a business or an individual, to enable full access to Tazapay services.

This process includes identity verification, compliance checks, and internal approval workflows in line with regulatory requirements.

Onboarding information can be submitted through:
- Tazapay APIs
- Tazapay Dashboard

Once all required information and documents are submitted through either channel, the entity enters the review and approval flow.

## Approval Process
All full entity onboarding requests are subject to an approval SLA. The SLA starts only after all mandatory details and documents are successfully submitted, whether via API or Dashboard. Approval timelines may vary based on the entity type, completeness and accuracy of the submission, and compliance or risk assessment requirements. The onboarding status can be tracked via the Dashboard or through the relevant status APIs.
