title: "Creating Entities"
description: "An entity represents an underlying customer that exists within the platform's master account, rather than as a separate account"
---
## Key Characteristics

- The account remains owned by your platform  
- All balance movements affect your single master balance  
- The entity is used for attribution, compliance visibility, and reporting  
- Funds remain in your platform’s flow  

## When This Model Is Typically Used

- Your platform is licensed to handle funds  
- You want consolidated balances.
- You need attribution without account-level separation  

## Operationally, How This Works

- Payouts / Collections are created on behalf of the entity  
- The entity represents the actual business or individual involved in the transaction  
- Tazapay attributes transactions, risk checks, and reporting to the entity  
- Financial impact continues to reflect on your platform’s master balance
