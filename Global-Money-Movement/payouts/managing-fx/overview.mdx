FX comes into play whenever funds move between different currencies during a payout.

Depending on your setup, FX can occur at
- Conversion from holding (balance currency) to payout currency
- Conversion from payout currency to destination currency
- Both

### Holding FX

**Balance currency → Payout currency**

This occurs when:
- Your holding balance is in one currency (e.g. USD)
- You initiate a payout in a different currency (e.g. EUR)
Tazapay converts funds from the holding currency to the payout currency as part of the payout flow.

### Destination FX

**Payout currency → Destination settlement currency**

This occurs when:

- The payout is initiated in one currency
- The destination bank or rail requires settlement in another currency

Tazapay handles the conversion transparently as part of routing and settlement.

> Tazapay also supports locking exchange rates across different stages of the payout lifecycle.
