## FIRA for India Payouts

When processing payouts to India, Tazapay generates a **Foreign Inward Remittance Advice (FIRA)** in compliance with **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** regulations.

### Role of Purpose Codes

The **Purpose Code** selected during payout initiation determines:

- How the transaction is classified under RBI guidelines
- The **type of FIRA** generated
- Whether the payout is successfully processed or rejected

> **Important**
>
> - FIRCs and FIRAs are generated **strictly based on the Purpose Code selected at the time of processing**
> - They **cannot be edited, revised, or reissued**
> - Incorrect selection may result in **RFIs, delays, or rejection** by banking partners
