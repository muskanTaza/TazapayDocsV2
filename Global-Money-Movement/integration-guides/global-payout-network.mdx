# Overview

Tazapay enables seamless global payouts through an integrated network of institutions and partners, ensuring transparency, compliance, and speed at every step.

### Key Participants

* **Sender**: The individual or business ultimately requesting the payment.
* **Sending Institution**: A financial institution (e.g., bank, licensed PSP) that initiates the payment on behalf of the sender.
* **Global Payout Network**: Intermediary platform that can facilitate transactions on behalf of sending institutions — including obtaining quotes, managing compliance interactions, and handling on-chain or off-chain transfers.
* **Tazapay**: Acts as the final-mile compliance and payout orchestrator, handling quote generation, beneficiary screening, and local or cross-currency disbursement.
* **Receiver**: The end beneficiary who receives the payment after all validations and fund transfers are completed.

### Built-in Compliance and Security

Every transaction facilitated through Tazapay is subjected to robust compliance checks, including:

* Sanction & PEP screening
* Adverse media and fraud risk detection
* Beneficiary account validation
* Real-time transaction approval workflows

This flow supports both fiat and digital asset infrastructures, making it adaptable for traditional institutions, modern fintechs, and next-generation financial ecosystems.

### Quote Generation (Steps 1-6)

When a sender wants to make a payment, they will approach the Sending Institution and ask for a quote which the sending institution will fetch from the Global Payout Network and ultimately Tazapay. Once the quote is generated by Tazapay, it will be presented back to the sender for confirmation that they would like to proceed with the payment.

### Payment Creation (Steps 7-11)

When the sender accepts the quote, the payment is then created by the GPN on Tazapay including beneficiary destination information and other mandatory information for the sender / sending institution. As part of payment creation, Tazapay

* evaluates the payment and creates a payment record.
* performs compliance screening

In case there is a compliance hit, Tazapay will reach out to the sending institution with an RFI using agreed channels with the GPN.

### On Chain Funds Transfer (Steps 12-13)

GPN shares the deposit address with the sending institution to transfer funds to Tazapay. Once Tazapay receives the funds, a record for an incoming payment is created on Tazapay. Tazapay notifies GPN via webhooks and GPN notifies the sending institution.

### Fiat Settlement and Notification (Steps 14-15)

Once the funding is completed, GPN can confirm the payout to be processed. This will allow Tazapay to associate the funds received with the corresponding payout object and immediately proceed with the fiat transfer to the receiver.
