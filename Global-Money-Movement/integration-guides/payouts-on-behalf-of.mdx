## Step 1: Create an Entity (Individual or Business)

An Entity represents a platform's or fintech's customer — the party on whose behalf the payout is being made. Every payout must be associated with an entity.

Tazapay supports two entity types:
- Business Entity – for registered companies
- Individual Entity – for individual customers (e.g., freelancers, creators, sole proprietors)

⚠️ Only entities with status **submitted** can be used to create payouts.

## Step 4: Handle Payout Events & Webhooks

Tazapay sends **webhooks** to notify you of payout state changes. You should always rely on webhooks (not polling) for final payout outcomes.

2. [Payout Webhook Events](/API-Reference/tazapay-api/payout/webhook-events)

4. [Payout Reversal Reasons](/API-Reference/appendix/payout-reversal-reasons)

### Best Practices

- Always verify webhook signatures  
- Make payout creation idempotent  
- Store payout event history for reconciliation
