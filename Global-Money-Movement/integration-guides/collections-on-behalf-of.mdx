Tazapay's **Collections on Behalf Of (COBO)** capability allows platforms / fintechs to receive funds on behalf of their customers which can be individual or business. Tazapay can configure **virtual accounts** or **stablecoin wallets** for your customers to receive payments.

This ensures compliance, traceability, and correct attribution of incoming funds.

## Step 1: Create an Entity (Individual or Business)

An Entity represents a platform's or fintech's customer — the party on whose behalf the collection is being made. Every virtual account or wallet must be associated with an entity.

Tazapay supports two entity types:

- **Business Entity** – for registered companies
- **Individual Entity** – for individual customers (e.g., freelancers, creators, sole proprietors)

<Warning>
Only entities with status **submitted** can be used to create virtual accounts or wallets.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Account or Stablecoin Wallet

Once you have a submitted entity, you can create a collection destination for them.

Tazapay supports two collection destination types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Virtual Accounts" icon="building-columns">
    Bank account numbers that can receive local or international transfers. Funds are automatically attributed to the associated entity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stablecoin Wallets" icon="wallet">
    Blockchain wallet addresses for receiving stablecoin payments (e.g., USDC, USDT). Ideal for crypto-native businesses.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 3: Share Account Details with Payer

Once the virtual account or wallet is created, share the account details with the payer (your customer's customer or counterparty).

<Tip>
You can retrieve the account details programmatically via API and display them in your platform's UI, or send them directly to the payer via email or invoice.
</Tip>

### Virtual Account Details Include

- Account number / IBAN
- Bank name and address
- SWIFT/BIC code (for international transfers)
- Routing number (for local transfers)
- Reference code (for attribution)

### Stablecoin Wallet Details Include

- Wallet address
- Supported networks
- Supported tokens

## Step 4: Receive and Attribute Incoming Funds

When a payer sends funds to the virtual account or wallet:

1. Tazapay receives the incoming transfer
2. Funds are automatically attributed to the associated entity
3. A webhook notification is sent to your platform

---

## Step 5: Handle Collection Events & Webhooks

Tazapay sends **webhooks** to notify you of collection events. You should always rely on webhooks (not polling) for real-time fund attribution.
