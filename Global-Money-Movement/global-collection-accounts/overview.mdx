Every Tazapay Account automatically gets access to a Global Collection Account — virtual accounts for multiple currencies and wallet addressed on various blockchains for stablecoins. These accounts let your customers pay you via local bank transfers, SWIFT, or supported stablecoins, giving them the experience of paying a local business while you avoid the cost and complexity of setting up local entities.

All collections flow into your Tazapay balance, where you can consolidate funds, withdraw in your preferred currency, or use them for payouts. Additional virtual accounts for fiat or virtual addresses for stablecoins can be requested anytime, making it easy to scale your global payment capabilities.
